# chess2025
Step 1 of my IOPCC entry for 2025

## Description

This is intended to be a functional programming style implementation of a mate in n moves
chess puzzle solver.  It is intended to be written in a functional style with single
parameter functions so that I can easily convert this to a string of nested lambda calls.

## Motivation

Last year (2024), I won an award in an obfuscated python coding contest: https://pyobfusc.com/#winners

This year, I plan to enter another program using the same idea.  In order to enhance previous
non-art, I will attempt a similar program that will use generating functions inside lambda
expressions (a specific no-no) and also disguise I/O operations as part of the functional
programming code (yet another no-no).  Ideally I will end up with a one-line lambda expression
that will read local data and produce jinja2 based html pages containing tables that were
formatted using pandas.

I may also write a utility to help convert the finished code here into ugly code later.

I also want to use this code for a web-tool where I have had the frontend sitting around
for years but I have not yet implemented the backend.
